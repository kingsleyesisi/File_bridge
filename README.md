## Installation
Follow these steps to get FileBridge up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kingsleyesisi/File_bridge.git
   cd File_bridge
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the database:**
   - FileBridge uses PostgreSQL. Make sure you have it installed and running. üêò
   - Update the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` in `app.py` with your PostgreSQL connection string.
   ```python
   app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://user:password@host:port/database_name'
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables:**
    - You may need to set the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable. If you don't the app will default to  `your-secret-key-change-this-in-production` in `app.py`.

6. **Run database migrations:**
   ```bash
   flask db init
   flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
   flask db upgrade
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python wsgi.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser and go to** `http://localhost:8000`.

3. **Start Sharing:**
   - Enter your name and a room name on the landing page.
   - Share the room name with others to collaborate.
   - Upload files using the paperclip icon.
   - Chat in real-time!

## Configuration
Here are some key configuration options you might want to tweak:

- **`SECRET_KEY`**: Used for session management.  **Important:** Change this in production!
  ```python
  app.secret_key = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', 'your-secret-key-change-this-in-production')
  ```

- **`SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`**: The database connection string. Update this to point to your PostgreSQL database.
  ```python
  app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://default:gN9Zeldkmb6P@ep-patient-bar-a49hhlnc-pooler.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech:5432/verceldb?sslmode=require'
  ```

- **File Size Limit**: The maximum file size is set to 50MB. This can be adjusted in `app.py` and `app.js`.
  ```python
   max_size = 50 * 1024 * 1024  # 50MB
  ```

## Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel

FileBridge is designed to be easily deployed to Vercel. Here's how:

1.  **Create a Vercel account:** Sign up at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
2.  **Install the Vercel CLI:**

    ```bash
    npm install -g vercel
    ```
3.  **Deploy:**

    ```bash
    vercel
    ```

    Follow the prompts to link your project and deploy.  Make sure to set the environment variables in your Vercel project settings.

### Production Considerations
- **Use a production-ready WSGI server:** Gunicorn is included in the `requirements.txt`.
  ```bash
  gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 wsgi:app
  ```
- **Set up a reverse proxy:** Use Nginx or Apache in front of your application for better performance and security.
- **Enable HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS in production.
- **Monitor your application:** Use tools like Sentry or New Relic to monitor your application for errors and performance issues.

## Troubleshooting
- **Problem:**  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'`
  - **Solution:** Make sure you activated the virtual environment and installed the dependencies.
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate  # Or venv\Scripts\activate.bat on Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- **Problem:** Database migrations failing.
  - **Solution:** Double-check your database connection string in `app.py`. Make sure the database server is running and accessible.

- **Problem:** SocketIO not connecting.
  - **Solution:** Ensure that your server allows WebSocket connections. Check your browser's console for any error messages.

- **Problem:** Files not uploading.
  - **Solution:** Make sure the file size is within the 50MB limit. Check the server logs for any file upload errors.

That's all for now! Happy sharing! üéâ
